// swift lets us create constants "let" and variables "var"
// if you dont instend to change the value of a variable 
// make sure to use "let" and make it a constant

// swifts strings contain text, from short strings up to whole novels. 
// they work great with both emoji and any world languages
// and have a helpful functionality such as "count" and "uppercased()"

// you create strings using double quotes at the start and end
// but if you want to have your string go over multiple lines you use triple quotes """

// swift calls its whole numbers integers and they can be positive and negative
// they also have helpful functionality such as "isMultiple(of:int)"

// in swift decimal numbers are called Double
// short for double-length floating-point number.
// that means they can hold very large numbers if needed
// but they also aren't 100% accurate. 
// you shouldnt use them when 100% precision is required
// such as dealing with money

// there are lotf of build-in arithmetic operators such as "+, -, * and /"
// along with special compound assignment operators such as "+=" that modify variablers directly

// you can represent a simple true or false statement by using boolean
// which can be flipped either by using the "!" operator or "toggle()"

// string interpolation lets us place constants and variables into our strings
// in a streamlined efficient way
