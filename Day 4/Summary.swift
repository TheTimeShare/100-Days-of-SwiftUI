// Arrays lets us store lots of values in one place then read them out using inger indices
// arrays must always be specialized so they contain one specific type and they have helpful functionality such as
count, append(), contains()

// Dictionaries also lets us store lots of values in one place but lets us read them out
// using keys we specify
// they most be specialized to have one specific type for key and another for the value
// and have similar functionality to arrays such as
contains() and count

// Sets are a third way of storing lots of values in one place but wont let us choose the
// order they store those items
// sets are really efficient at finding weather they contain a specific item

// Enums lets us create our own simple types in swift so that we cacn specify a range
// of acceptable values sucj as a list of actions the user can perform the types of
// files we are able to write or the types we are able to write or the types of
// notification to send to the user

// Swift must always know the type of data inside a constant or variable and mostly uses
// "type inference" to figure that out based on the data we assign
// however its also possible to use "type annotation" to force a particular type

// Out of arrays, dictionaries and sets its safe to say that you will use arrays by far
// the most after that comes dictionaries and sets come a distant third
// that dosent mean sets arent useful but you will know when you need them!
